# CPU Scheduler for OwlTech

## **Project Overview**
This project is designed to demonstrate CPU scheduling techniques to make the OwlTech. 
## **Usage**
- **SRTF**: Shortest Remaining Time First - Simulates a CPU scheduler that incorporates a scheduler that schedules based on the processes burst length.
- **EDF**: Earliest Deadline First - Simulates a CPU scheduler that incorporates a scheduler that schedules based on the processes deadline value.

## **SetUp**
- Java Environment
- Java Complier 

## **Installation**
- Use GitHub repository to attain source code for use od CPU scheduler.
- Copy to know compiler and run.
## **Know Problems**
- **Possible Starvation with SRTF dependent on process load.
- **Possible long wait times for EDF due to deadline sorting.
